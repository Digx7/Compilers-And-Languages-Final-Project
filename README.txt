    The following report is for the final project for the 
Compilers and Languages class (CPSC 323-05) at California 
State University Fullerton taught by Professor Mohmamadreza 
Ahmadnia in the Spring 2023 semester.  Both this report and 
project were made by Everette and Abraham.  The purpose of 
this project was to make a small compiler to work on a given 
program, validate or reject it, and convert it to c++.

    Below you will find: The Original Program ment to be compiled, 
The Original Grammar for that program, The Original Grammar converted 
to BNF for, The Preparation done to the grammar to make a Predictive 
Parsing Table, The First and Follow table of the prepared grammar, 
the Predictive Parsing Table, and lastly all the code for the 
compiler itself. 

    Inorder to run the code for our compiler a copy has been 
included in the flash drive associated with this report.  
The file is called ‘FinalProject.cpp’.  For your convenience 
a ‘run.cmd’ and a ‘run.bash’ file has been included to make 
compiling and running our code easier.  Should both of these fail, 
simply try compiling and executing our code yourself.

    To help test our compiler we have included multiple text files.  
The file ‘finalp1.txt’ is the original program below.  Others are 
ment to show case the different errors our compiler can catch.

    All the documents can be found in the flash drive included with this 
report and at the GitHub link here:
